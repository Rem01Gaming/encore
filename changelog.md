### Changelog

While this release may appear minor on the surface, the entire codebase has undergone significant refactoring and migration. The previously C-based daemon has been completely rewritten in C++ to leverage abstraction and object-oriented programming. Similarly, the WebUI has been fully rebuilt in VueJS, enabling a native-like single-page application experience.

- Massive internal refactoring and code migration
- UI/UX improvements in WebUI
- Drop support for logging system interface to other processes/module
- Fix performance profile stuck when exiting games
- Other misc changes and optimizations
